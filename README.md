# Assignment Scenario 

Programming a Zumo Robot to find and rescue people trapped on a single floor.

# Main Components

1. A maze with corridors and a number of objects around to simulate the scenario. 
2. Zumo Robot coded using Arduino IDE
3. XBee module so that the Robot can communicate wirelessly with the computer.
4. XCTU software to set up XBee and Zumo communitation

* A - Left
* W - Up
* D - Right 
* S - Down

Mode 2 : Fully autonomous - Zumo will be detecting the rooms and objects using the sensors. 

# Instructions

1. Connect the XBee PRO S1 (the coordinator) to the PC using the USB cable 
2. Open XCTU 
3. Add the XBee clicking on "Add Radio Module" button
4. Connect Zumo to the PC using the USB cable (Remove XBee from the Robot)
5. Open Arduino 
6. Upload Code
7. Put XBee in the Robot
8. Swith ON 
9. And watch the magic do it's work !!!
